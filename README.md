# Notion Renderer
A quick way to construct a website with notion pages.

To add pages, modify `config.js` to include however many Notion page ids needed. This will add the page titles in the menu as well.

## Setup
```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start
